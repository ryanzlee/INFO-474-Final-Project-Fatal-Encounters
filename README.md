### Our final visualization demonstrating the fatal encounters across the U.S. with dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/konradb/fatal-encounters-database)
The dataset that drives our visualizations come from the “Fatal Encounters Database”, consisting of a national database of the people who are killed through interactions with the police nationwide. The dataset contains roughly, 31,000 different items(rows) of fatal encounters, each coded across 36 unique attributes to be used. Specifically, the dataset contains a mixture of quantitative variables such as the age, date, and the latitude and longitude of the individual who meets death during the encounter with the law enforcement official, as well as qualitative variables such as name, gender, race, police department involved, and the highest level of force used.
